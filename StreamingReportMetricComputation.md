# Computation of Report Metrics

## Background: 

We are given a CSV file with the a list of user data, specifically, the user id, age and favorite color. We would like to generate a reporting mechansims to compute different metrics about the users. In general, we don't know the file size that will be provided (and it might not fit into memory), hence we need plan to avoid these assumptions.

## Requirements

- Approximate constant memory usage for computation of reports (i.e., can't load the data all into memory at one time)
- Iterate exactly ONCE over the file/data
- Compute the following metrics using scala and print a summary to stdout 
  - Total number of users processed
  - Mean age of all users
  - Median age of all users
  - Top 5 favorite colors
  - Total number of users processed with age greater than 21
  - Mean age of all users with age greater than 21
  - Median age of all users with age greater than 21
  - Top 5 favorite colors of user with age greater than 21
  

Reminder, the data/file can only be iterated over ONCE and memory consumption remain approximately constant.
